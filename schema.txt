Determining if user like posts possible solution: You may use your suggested approach, but instead of retreiving all liked posts, 
you may add whereIn clause to select only those which are in $posts collection. And then again walk through the $posts collection to determine, whether it is in $likes collection. I think that will be fast enough.
